            Banzai Roulette is a web app utilizing Ruby on Rails as a framework, PostgreSQL database, and the public APIs Giphy, and Facebook. The front end is styled with Javascript(vanilla, jQuery), and CSS(Bootstrap, Materialize). The user signs in with Facebook, and creates a game 'lobby' and invites others via email. Each user will select a word/phrase, and once the game is complete, the loser returns to the lobby, selects the 'I lose' button, and the app will randomly select one of the chosen words/phrases and posts a single 'gif' to the loser's Facebook wall. The app was created as a final demo product to fellow students, faculty, and public at Lighthouse Labs to showcase the skills learned throughout the program.
